        <h2>Build Web Apps With Angular!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Angular is one of the most popular modern web development frameworks out there!
    </p>
    <p>
        It's getting used by thousands of developers and companies since it allows developers to build powerful, highly interactive web applications with ease!
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst you could use "just JavaScript" to build such applications, Angular vastly simplifies the process and allows you to build applications with a clear, modular structure - a feature that's especially important as applications become more complex.
